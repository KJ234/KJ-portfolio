           <h2>About</h2> 
           <p>Hello, my name is Komal Javed, and I am 18 years old. I am interested in learning how to code. I hope to improve my skills through this course so that I can get a career in this field in the future.I don't have much to show or say right now because I've only recently started studying, but I'll be adding to this website as time goes on. This website should be loaded with several projects that I have produced and contributed to. Once I have completed the 6-month bootcamp. This webpage can then be shown to future employers who are interested in hiring me.</p>

                <p class = "text1">This project was to refactor code for an existing site to make it more accessible. My job was to copy the starter code to my own repository and add details so that I can improve the code. For example, the images previously in index.html were missing alt attributes, which have now been added.
